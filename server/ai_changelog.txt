## Authentication and User Profile Routes Implementation

### Initial Username Route Implementation
- Implemented initial routing for usernames with @ symbol
- Created route pattern `/@:username` to match user profiles
- Added basic authentication checks and user profile component

### Major Routing Overhaul - Brand and Event Nesting
1. Initial Challenge:
   - Needed to support nested routes: `/@username/@brandname/@eventname`
   - Required handling both authenticated and public routes
   - Had to maintain the @ symbol in URLs while keeping clean route parameters

2. First Solution Attempt:
   - Used direct path matching with @ symbol in route definitions
   - Structure:
     ```javascript
     // Authenticated routes
     <Route path="/@:username/*">
       <Route path="/@:brandUsername" element={<BrandProfile />} />
       <Route path="/@:brandUsername/@:eventUsername" element={<EventDetails />} />
     </Route>
     
     // Public routes
     <Route path="/@:brandUsername" element={<BrandProfile />} />
     <Route path="/@:brandUsername/@:eventUsername" element={<EventDetails />} />
     ```
   - Issues encountered:
     - Route parameters weren't being captured correctly
     - Wildcard matching interfered with nested routes
     - Public/authenticated route conflicts

3. Final Working Solution:
   - Implemented a more structured approach using nested Routes
   - Key changes:
     ```javascript
     // Parent route handles @ prefix
     <Route path={`${userProfilePath}/*`} element={
       <Routes>
         <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
         // Child routes handle clean parameters
         <Route path=":brandUsername" element={<BrandProfile />} />
         <Route path=":brandUsername/:eventUsername" element={<EventDetails />} />
       </Routes>
     } />
     ```
   - Benefits:
     - Clean parameter capture
     - Proper nested route handling
     - Clear separation between authenticated and public routes
     - Maintained URL structure with @ symbols

### Authentication System Enhancements
- Implemented token-based authentication
- Added refresh token mechanism
- Created AuthContext for global state management
- Added route protection and redirection
- Implemented user session persistence

### Route Debugging System
- Added comprehensive route debugging system
- Implemented RouteDebug component for detailed logging
- Added path matching validation
- Enhanced error reporting for route mismatches

### Brand Profile Implementation
- Created BrandProfile component
- Added public and authenticated views
- Implemented brand data fetching
- Added user role management
- Implemented brand settings and customization

### Event System Implementation
- Created event routes and components
- Added nested event routing under brands
- Implemented event creation and management
- Added event details and editing capabilities

### Search System Implementation
- Added global search functionality
- Implemented brand and event search
- Added user search capabilities
- Created search result routing

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added loading states
- Implemented error handling
- Added toast notifications
- Enhanced navigation experience
- Added responsive design elements

### Brand Management Updates
- Relocated Brands listing page to user profile namespace
- Added route `/@username/brands` for authenticated users
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing brand functionality
- Integrated with nested routing structure
- Benefits:
  - Cleaner URL structure
  - Proper namespace organization
  - Consistent with social media-like URL patterns
  - Clear separation between brand listing and individual brand profiles

### Brand Navigation Updates
- Updated all brand-related navigation to use new URL patterns
- Changed paths:
  - Brands listing: `/brands` → `/@username/brands`
  - Brand profiles: `/brands/brandname` → `/@username/@brandname`
  - Brand navigation: Updated in dashboard, notifications, and other components
- Benefits:
  - Consistent URL structure across the application
  - Proper nesting under user profiles
  - Clearer ownership and context in URLs
  - Improved user experience with predictable paths

### Navigation Updates
- Updated home navigation to use new URL pattern
- Changed paths:
  - Home navigation: `/dashboard` → `/@username`
  - Back button default: `/dashboard` → `/@username`
- Benefits:
  - Consistent navigation behavior
  - Aligned with user profile-centric structure
  - Improved user experience with predictable paths

## Ongoing Development
- Continue monitoring route performance
- Enhance error handling
- Improve user experience
- Add additional features as needed

## Technical Debt and Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing route caching
2. Optimize route matching performance
3. Add more comprehensive error boundaries
4. Enhance debugging capabilities
5. Consider implementing route-based code splitting

## Notes
- All route changes maintain backward compatibility
- URL structure preserves @ symbol for social media-like feel
- Authentication state is properly maintained across route changes
- Route debugging provides detailed insights for troubleshooting
